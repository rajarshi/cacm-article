@article{Breiman:2001fk,
	Abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

@article{Kind:2010zr,
	Abstract = {The structural elucidation of small molecules using mass spectrometry plays an important role in modern life sciences and bioanalytical approaches. This review covers different soft and hard ionization techniques and figures of merit for modern mass spectrometers, such as mass resolving power, mass accuracy, isotopic abundance accuracy, accurate mass multiple-stage MS(n) capability, as well as hybrid mass spectrometric and orthogonal chromatographic approaches. The latter part discusses mass spectral data handling strategies, which includes background and noise subtraction, adduct formation and detection, charge state determination, accurate mass measurements, elemental composition determinations, and complex data-dependent setups with ion maps and ion trees. The importance of mass spectral library search algorithms for tandem mass spectra and multiple-stage MS(n) mass spectra as well as mass spectral tree libraries that combine multiple-stage mass spectra are outlined. The successive chapter discusses mass spectral fragmentation pathways, biotransformation reactions and drug metabolism studies, the mass spectral simulation and generation of in silico mass spectra, expert systems for mass spectral interpretation, and the use of computational chemistry to explain gas-phase phenomena. A single chapter discusses data handling for hyphenated approaches including mass spectral deconvolution for clean mass spectra, cheminformatics approaches and structure retention relationships, and retention index predictions for gas and liquid chromatography. The last section reviews the current state of electronic data sharing of mass spectra and discusses the importance of software development for the advancement of structure elucidation of small molecules. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12566-010-0015-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.},

@article{glaxo-malaria,
	Abstract = {Malaria is a devastating infection caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Drug resistance is widespread, no new chemical class of antimalarials has been introduced into clinical practice since 1996 and there is a recent rise of parasite strains with reduced sensitivity to the newest drugs. We screened nearly 2 million compounds in GlaxoSmithKline's chemical library for inhibitors of P. falciparum, of which 13,533 were confirmed to inhibit parasite growth by at least 80\% at 2 microM concentration. More than 8,000 also showed potent activity against the multidrug resistant strain Dd2. Most (82\%) compounds originate from internal company projects and are new to the malaria community. Analyses using historic assay data suggest several novel mechanisms of antimalarial action, such as inhibition of protein kinases and host-pathogen interaction related targets. Chemical structures and associated data are hereby made public to encourage additional drug lead identification efforts and further research into this disease.},

@article{Masek:2008kx,
	Abstract = {Studies to assess the risks of revealing chemical structures by sharing various chemical descriptor data are presented. Descriptors examined include "Lipinski-like" properties, 2D-BCUT descriptors, and a high-dimensional "fingerprint-like" descriptor (MACCs-vector). We demonstrate that unless sufficient precautions are taken, de novo design software such as EA-Inventor is able to derive a unique chemical structure or a set of closely related analogs from some commonly used descriptors. Based on the results of our studies, a set of guidelines or recommendations for safely sharing chemical information without revealing chemical structure is presented. A procedure for assessing the risk of revealing chemical structure when exchanging chemical descriptor information was also developed. The procedure is generic and can be applied to any chemical descriptor or combination of descriptors and to any set of structures to enable a decision about whether the exchange of information can be done without revealing the chemical structures.},

Two physical property datasets are applied as case studies of the inverse QSPR workflow (IQW): mean molecular polarizability and aqueous solubility. The case studies demonstrate the optimization of molecular structures to within a property range of interest; the optimized structures are then validated against QSPR models that are generated from sets of alternative descriptors to those used in the IQW. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results from the case studies.},

@article{Sayle:2009uq,
	Abstract = {Chemical compound names remain the primary method for conveying molecular structures between chemists and researchers. In research articles, patents, chemical catalogues, government legislation, and textbooks, the use of IUPAC and traditional compound names is universal, despite efforts to introduce more machine-friendly representations such as identifiers and line notations. Fortunately, advances in computing power now allow chemical names to be parsed and generated (read and written) with almost the same ease as conventional connection tables. A significant complication, however, is that although the vast majority of chemistry uses English nomenclature, a significant fraction is in other languages. This complicates the task of filing and analyzing chemical patents, purchasing from compound vendors, and text mining research articles or Web pages. We describe some issues with manipulating chemical names in various languages, including British, American, German, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Polish, and Hungarian, and describe the current state-of-the-art in software tools to simplify the process.},

@article{Swamidass:2007ve,
	Abstract = {Chemical fingerprints are used to represent chemical molecules by recording the presence or absence, or by counting the number of occurrences, of particular features or substructures, such as labeled paths in the 2D graph of bonds, of the corresponding molecule. These fingerprint vectors are used to search large databases of small molecules, currently containing millions of entries, using various similarity measures, such as the Tanimoto or Tversky's measures and their variants. Here, we derive simple bounds on these similarity measures and show how these bounds can be used to considerably reduce the subset of molecules that need to be searched. We consider both the case of single-molecule and multiple-molecule queries, as well as queries based on fixed similarity thresholds or aimed at retrieving the top K hits. We study the speedup as a function of query size and distribution, fingerprint length, similarity threshold, and database size |D| and derive analytical formulas that are in excellent agreement with empirical values. The theoretical considerations and experiments show that this approach can provide linear speedups of one or more orders of magnitude in the case of searches with a fixed threshold, and achieve sublinear speedups in the range of O(|D|0.6) for the top K hits in current large databases. This pruning approach yields subsecond search times across the 5 million compounds in the ChemDB database, without any loss of accuracy.},

	Abstract = {A series of 39 (a training set of 29 and a test set of 10) interphenylene 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1]heptane oxazole thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonists were studied using four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (4D-QSAR) analysis. Two thousand conformations of each analogue were sampled to generate a conformational energy profile (CEP) from a molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) of 100,000 trajectory states. Each conformation was placed in a grid cell lattice for each of six trial alignments. Cubic grid cell sizes of 1 and 2 A were considered. The frequency of occupation of each grid cell was computed for each of seven types of pharmacophoric group classes of atoms of each compound. These grid cell occupancy descriptors (GCODs) were then used as independent variables in constructing three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR models after data reduction. The types of data reduction included doing no reducing, reduction based on individual GCOD correlation with activity, and reduction from minimum variance constraints over the GCOD population. The 3D-QSAR models were generated and evaluated by a scheme that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization with partial least squares (PLS) regression. The 3D-QSAR models were evaluated by cross-validation using the leave-one-out technique. The cross-validated correlation coefficient, Q2, ranged from 0.27 to 0.86. The models are not from chance correlation because a scrambled data set was generated and evaluated (Q2 = 0.25-0.37). A composite 3D-QSAR model was constructed using the best models derived from GCODs of both 1 and 2 A grid cell size lattices. The 3D-QSAR models provide detailed 3D pharmacophore requirements in terms of atom types and corresponding locations needed for high TXA2 inhibition activity. Specific sites in space that should not be occupied by an active inhibitor are also specified. The GCOD measures for the compounds in the training set permit reference points regarding which pharmacophore sites can provide the largest boosts in inhibition activity relative to the existing analogues.},

	Abstract = {Predictive models are widely used in computer-aided drug discovery, particularly for identifying potentially biologically active molecules based on training sets of compounds with known activity or inactivity. The use of these models (amongst others) has enabled "virtual screens" to be used to identify compounds in large data sets that are predicted to be active, and which would thus be good candidates for experimental testing. The PubChem BioAssay database contains an increasing amount of experimental data from biological screens that has the potential to be used to train predictive models for a wide range of assays and targets, yet there has been little work carried out on using this data to build models. In this paper, we take an initial look at this by investigating the quality of naive Bayesian predictive models built using BioAssay data, and find that overall the predictive quality of such models is good, indicating that they could have utility in virtual screening.},

As this strategy emerged, academic researchers began performing high-throughput screens (HTS) of small molecules--the type of experiments once exclusively conducted in industry--and making the data from these screens available to all. Several methods can mine this data to inform repurposing and repositioning efforts. Despite these methods' limitations, it is hopeful that they will accelerate the discovery of new uses for known drugs, but this hope has not yet been realized.},

As the ability to measure molecules in high-throughput ways has improved over the past decade, it is logical that such data might be useful for enabling drug repositioning through computational methods. Many computational predictions for new indications have been borne out in cellular model systems, though extensive animal model and clinical trial-based validation are still pending. In this review, we show that computational methods for drug repositioning can be classified in two axes: drug based, where discovery initiates from the chemical perspective, or disease based, where discovery initiates from the clinical perspective of disease or its pathology. Newer algorithms for computational drug repositioning will likely span these two axes, will take advantage of newer types of molecular measurements, and will certainly play a role in reducing the global burden of disease.},

@article{Klebe:1994ly,
	Abstract = {An alternative approach is reported to compute property fields based on similarity indices of drug molecules that have been brought into a common alignment. The fields of different physicochemical properties use a Gaussian-type distance dependence, and no singularities occur at the atomic positions. Accordingly, no arbitrary definitions of cutoff limits and deficiencies due to different slopes of the fields are encountered. The fields are evaluated by a PLS analysis similar to the CoMFA formalism. Two data sets of steroids binding to the corticosteroid-binding-globulin and thermolysin inhibitors were analyzed in terms of the conventional CoMFA method (Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential fields) and the new comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA). Models of comparative statistical significance were obtained. Field contribution maps were produced for the different models. Due to cutoff settings in the CoMFA fields and the steepness of the potentials close to the molecular surface, the CoMFA maps are often rather fragmentary and not contiguously connected. This makes their interpretation difficult. The maps obtained by the new CoMSIA approach are superior and easier to interpret. Whereas the CoMFA maps denote regions apart from the molecules where interactions with a putative environment are to be expected, the CoMSIA maps highlight those regions within the area occupied by the ligand skeletons that require a particular physicochemical property important for activity. This is a more significant guide to trace the features that really matter especially with respect to the design of novel compounds.},

	Abstract = {SMILES strings and other classic 2D structural formats offer a convenient
	way to represent molecules as a simplistic connection table, with
	the inherent advantages of ease of handling and storage. In the context
	of virtual screening, chemical databases to be screened are often
	initially represented by canonicalised SMILES strings that can be
	filtered and pre-processed in a number of ways, resulting in molecules
	that occupy similar regions of chemical space to active compounds
	of a therapeutic target. A wide variety of software exists to convert
	molecules into SMILES format, namely, Mol2smi (Daylight Inc.), MOE
	(Chemical Computing Group) and Babel (Openeye Scientific Software).
	Depending on the algorithm employed, the atoms of a SMILES string
	defining a molecule can be ordered differently. Upon conversion to
	3D coordinates they result in the production of ostensibly the same
	molecule.In this work we show how different permutations of a SMILES
	string can affect conformer generation, affecting reliability and
	repeatability of the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel procedure
	for the generation of conformers, taking advantage of the permutation
	of the input strings--both SMILES and other 2D formats, leading to
	more effective sampling of conformation space in output, and also
	implementing fingerprint and principal component analyses step to

	Abstract = {Ligand docking is a widely used approach in virtual screening. In
	recent years a large number of publications have appeared in which
	docking tools are compared and evaluated for their effectiveness
	in virtual screening against a wide variety of protein targets. These
	studies have shown that the effectiveness of docking in virtual screening
	is highly variable due to a large number of possible confounding
	factors. Another class of method that has shown promise in virtual
	screening is the shape-based, ligand-centric approach. Several direct
	comparisons of docking with the shape-based tool ROCS have been conducted
	using data sets from some of these recent docking publications. The
	results show that a shape-based, ligand-centric approach is more
	consistent than, and often superior to, the protein-centric approach
	taken by docking.},

	Abstract = {The growing consensus that most valuable data source for biomedical
	discoveries is derived from human samples is clearly reflected in
	the growing number of translational medicine and translational sciences
	departments across pharma as well as academic and government supported
	initiatives such as Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA)
	in the US and the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of EU with emphasis
	on translating research for human health.The pharmaceutical companies
	of Johnson and Johnson have established translational and biomarker
	departments and implemented an effective knowledge management framework
	including building a data warehouse and the associated data mining
	applications. The implemented resource is built from open source
	systems such as i2b2 and GenePattern.The system has been deployed
	across multiple therapeutic areas within the pharmaceutical companies
	of Johnson and Johnsons and being used actively to integrate and
	mine internal and public data to support drug discovery and development
	decisions such as indication selection and trial design in a translational
	medicine setting. Our results show that the established system allows
	scientist to quickly re-validate hypotheses or generate new ones
	with the use of an intuitive graphical interface.The implemented
	resource can serve as the basis of precompetitive sharing and mining
	of studies involving samples from human subjects thus enhancing our
	understanding of human biology and pathophysiology and ultimately
	leading to more effective treatment of diseases which represent unmet
	medical needs.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The decomposition of a chemical graph is a convenient approach to encode information of the corresponding organic compound. While several commercial toolkits exist to encode molecules as so-called fingerprints, only a few open source implementations are available. The aim of this work is to introduce a library for exactly defined molecular decompositions, with a strong focus on the application of these features in machine learning and data mining. It provides several options such as search depth, distance cut-offs, atom- and pharmacophore typing. Furthermore, it provides the functionality to combine, to compare, or to export the fingerprints into several {formats.RESULTS}:We provide a Java 1.6 library for the decomposition of chemical graphs based on the open source Chemistry Development Kit toolkit. We reimplemented popular fingerprinting algorithms such as depth-first search fingerprints, extended connectivity fingerprints, autocorrelation fingerprints (e.g. {CATS2D}), radial fingerprints (e.g. {Molprint2D}), geometrical Molprint, atom pairs, and pharmacophore fingerprints. We also implemented custom fingerprints such as the all-shortest path fingerprint that only includes the subset of shortest paths from the full set of paths of the depth-first search fingerprint. As an application of {jCompoundMapper}, we provide a command-line executable binary. We measured the conversion speed and number of features for each encoding and described the composition of the features in detail. The quality of the encodings was tested using the default parametrizations in combination with a support vector machine on the Sutherland {QSAR} data sets. Additionally, we benchmarked the fingerprint encodings on the large-scale Ames toxicity benchmark using a large-scale linear support vector machine. The results were promising and could often compete with literature results. On the large Ames benchmark, for example, we obtained an {AUC} {ROC} performance of 0.87 with a reimplementation of the extended connectivity fingerprint. This result is comparable to the performance achieved by a non-linear support vector machine using state-of-the-art descriptors. On the Sutherland {QSAR} data set, the best fingerprint encodings showed a comparable or better performance on 5 of the 8 benchmarks when compared against the results of the best descriptors published in the paper of Sutherland et {al.CONCLUSIONS}:{jCompoundMapper} is a library for chemical graph fingerprints with several tweaking possibilities and exporting options for open source data mining toolkits. The quality of the data mining results, the conversion speed, the {LPGL} software license, the command-line interface, and the exporters should be useful for many applications in cheminformatics like benchmarks against literature methods, comparison of data mining algorithms, similarity searching, and similarity-based data mining.},
